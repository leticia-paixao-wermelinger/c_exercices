Exercice: Rotate a Matrix by 90 Degrees

In this exercise, you are required to implement a function that rotates a given rectangular matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

The input matrix is represented as an array of characters, where each row contains a string of characters, and the rows are of equal length.

The function should take as input an array of strings and return a new array, representing the rotated matrix.

Function Signature:
char **rotate_matrix_90dg(char **matrix);

Example:
Given the input matrix:
ABC
DEF
GHI
JKL
After rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the output should be:
JGDA
KHEB
LIFC
